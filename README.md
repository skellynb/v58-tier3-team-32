# **ChinguVerse - Chingu Member Demographics Map**

The Chingu Member Demographics Map is a web application that displays demographic information about Chingu members across the world. It helps users explore where Chingus live, their roles, tiers, and other attributes — all shown visually on an interactive world map and in a searchable list view.

## **Overview**

This app was built as part of the Chingu Voyage Project(V58-TIER3-TEAM-32). It aims to help the community visualize Chingu demographics in a fun and interactive way.

Users can:

View where Chingus are located on a map

Filter results by multiple attributes (like role, tier, country, or gender)

View detailed member data in a list

Optionally chat with an AI assistant to learn how to use the app.
